## Building with Kit

Kit is the email-first operating system for creators who mean business. Our developer platform offers a host of functionality to help our 600,000+ creators automate and extend their workflows with tools they already use, and ones they haven't even dreamed of yet.

What will you build?

## Key concepts

New around here? Here's what you need to know to get started.

### Kit App Store

The Kit App Store is the landing page for your app. It is a place where creators can discover and install apps to incorporate into their workflows.

### Apps

Kit apps are third-party integrations that developers can build to extend Kit's functionality, allowing creators to connect external platforms with their Kit account. These apps can include API access for connecting external platforms, plugins for embedding content directly in Kit's interface, or both, and are published through Kit's App Store after approval.

### Plugins

Kit plugins are modular extensions that allow developers to add custom content directly into the Kit app UI, enabling integration between Kit and third-party platforms to display dynamic content within the user experience. These plugins authenticate against third-party services to pull required data, allowing creators to access external content without leaving Kit's interface. 

### API

Kit API v4 is a complete rebuild of Kit's developer interface that supports OAuth for applications and API keys for personal account automation. It offers improved performance with features like cursor-based pagination, consistent error handling, and a fully functional broadcast API, enabling developers to create integrations that help creators automate tasks and connect their marketing technology stack.
